    - If there are open issues or merge requests, check if they are still relevant for the current Release

    - authors who were directly involved in the development of the current Release are listed in the CITATION.cff
    - people who are not involved in the current Release are listed in AUTHORS.md

## 2. Update the Changelog

- Update the Changelog.md

## 3. Prepare Release

1. Merge the develop branch into main branch on https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids
    - this can be done by creating a Merge Request from develop to main [here](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request%5Bsource_branch%5D=develop&merge_request%5Btarget_branch%5D=main)
2. Create a tag on [gitlab](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/tags/new) from the main branch. Name of the tag can be the current version number.
3. Tag and Main Branch are automatically mirrored to https://github.com/irmb/virtualfluids
4. Create a new Release on [gitlab](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/releases/new) and [github](https://github.com/irmb/virtualfluids/releases/new) based on the new tag
5. When Zenodo sees the new release on github, it automatically creates a new version on Zenodo. If all went successful you can find it [here](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/repository/irmb/virtualfluids).
   - this requires that the Zenodo account is linked to the github account and the repository is enabled on Zenodo. See how to link an account [here](https://help.zenodo.org/docs/profile/linking-accounts/).
    - [more information](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content) about integration of zenodo with github
