# Coding Guidelines

This document lists C++ coding recommendations common in the C++ development community. The recommendations are based on established standards collected from several sources, individual experience, local requirements/needs, as well as suggestions.

There are many reasons for introducing a new guideline rather than just referring to the ones above. The main reason is that these guides are far too general in their scope and that more specific rules (especially naming rules) need to be established. Also, the present guide has an annotated form that makes it easier to use during project code reviews than most other existing guidelines. In addition, programming recommendations generally tend to mix style issues with language technical issues in a somewhat confusing manner. The present document does not contain any C++ technical recommendations at all, but focuses mainly on programming style. For guidelines on C++ programming style, refer to the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).

In the guideline sections the terms must, should and can have special meaning. A must requirement must be followed, a should is a strong recommendation, and a can is a general guideline.
The recommendations' primary purpose is to increase readability, which in turn improves understanding, maintainability, and overall code quality. It is impossible to cover all the specific cases in a general guide, so the programmer must be flexible.
