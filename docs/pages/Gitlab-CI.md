# Gitlab CI

VirtualFluids is using Gitlab CI to automate the build, test and deployment process. The Gitlab CI is configured in the file `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root folder of the repository. The configuration is based on the [Gitlab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

Most Gitlab CI jobs are running whith each push to the repository. Additionally, some jobs are running on a schedule. The schedule is defined [here](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/pipeline_schedules).

Almost all jobs are based on the Docker image from the Gitlab CI Docker Registry.

## Gitlab Runner

There a currently three machines, where the ci jobs are running. The machines are called `runner1`, `runner2` and `runner3`. The machines are running on the Gitlab Runner software.
The computers are located in the old VR-Lab in the cellar of the TU Braunschweig.
The runner are registered in the Gitlab project and are using the tags `runner1`, `runner2` and `runner3`. The tags are used in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to define on which runner the job should run.
All Gitlab runner are shared to all members in the irmb group through this shared project: https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/shared/runner/-/settings/ci_cd
Thats why all members of the irmb group can use the runner in their own projects. They need to be enabled for every new project. (e.g. virtualfluids project: https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/settings/ci_cd)


### Runner1 (Linux)
- IP: 134.169.81.206

- Tags: linux, gpu, priviliged
- Docker based
- gitlab runner is installed and updated via ubuntu package manager.

#### Update NVIDIA Driver:
- get newest driver link from here: https://www.nvidia.com/de-de/drivers/
- copy the download Link. e.g. https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
- login to runner via ssh
```
 wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
```
- change permission
```
sudo chmod +x <driver-file-name>
```
- install driver ( e.g. 550.90.07.):
```
sudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
```
Follow the steps (this different between runner01 and runner02!!!):
1. continue installation
2. continue installation
3. OK
4.  Install NVIDIA's 32-bit compatibility libraries?
    * NO
* OK
* Rebuild Initramfs
* Would you like to run the nvidia-xconfig utility to automatically update your X  configuration file so that the NVIDIA X driver will be used when you restart X?  Any pre-existing X configuration file will be backed up.       
    * NO
* OK

Follow the steps (this different between runner01 and runner02!!!):
1. continue installation
2. continue installation
3.  Install NVIDIA's 32-bit compatibility libraries?
    * NO
* Would you like to register the kernel module sources with DKMS? This will allow DKMS to automatically build a new module, if your kernel changes later
    * NO
* OK
* Would you like to run the nvidia-xconfig utility to automatically update your X  configuration file so that the NVIDIA X driver will be used when you restart X?  Any pre-existing X configuration file will be backed up.       
    * NO
* OK
