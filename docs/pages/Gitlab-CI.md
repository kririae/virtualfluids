# Gitlab CI

VirtualFluids is using Gitlab CI to automate the build, test and deployment process. The Gitlab CI is configured in the file `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root folder of the repository. The configuration is based on the [Gitlab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

Most Gitlab CI jobs are running whith each push to the repository. Additionally, some jobs are running on a schedule. The schedule is defined [here](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/pipeline_schedules).

Almost all jobs are based on the Docker image from the Gitlab CI Docker Registry.

## Phoenix HPC Usage
The institute uses a "Funktionsaccount" to run simulations from the CI-Pipeline on the Phoenix HPC cluster (for example the multi-gpu test).
The CI job uses the [HPC-Rocket](https://github.com/SvenMarcus/hpc-rocket) to communicate with the Phoenix HPC cluster. In order to access the cluster, some environments-variables, like the hostname, username and ssh-key needs to be provided. The environment-variables are stored in the [Gitlab CI/CD settings](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/settings/ci_cd) of the project.

## Gitlab Runner

There a currently three machines, where the ci jobs are running. The machines are called `gitlab-runner01`, `gitlab-runner02` and `gitlab-runner03`. The machines are running on the Gitlab Runner software.
The computers are located in the old VR-Lab in the cellar of the TU Braunschweig.
The runner are registered in the Gitlab project and are using the tags `linux`, `win` and `gpu`. The tags are used in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to define on which runner the job should run.
All Gitlab runner are shared to all Maintainer in this sub-project: https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/shared/runner/-/settings/ci_cd.
With this they can use the runner in their own projects. They need to be enabled for every new project. (e.g. virtualfluids project: https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/irmb/VirtualFluids/-/settings/ci_cd).

The Gitlab-Runner are registered to the GITZ Gitlab and can be found in the CI/CD - Runner part of the project settings.


### gitlab-runner01 and gitlab-runner02 (Linux)
- IP: 134.169.81.206/207
- Linux Version: Ubuntu 22.04
- Docker based
- gitlab runner is installed and updated via ubuntu package manager.



#### Update / Install NVIDIA Driver:
Nvidia Driver needs to be reinstalled after every kernel update of the OS.

0. (Optional!) Download a newer driver. Only on demand, for example a new cuda version requires a new driver. Its needs to be checked if the new driver is compatible with the GPU. With a new driver the installation script might needs to be updated - so start the installation with a new driver manually first.
    - get newest driver link from here: https://www.nvidia.com/de-de/drivers/
    - copy the download Link. e.g. https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
    - login to runner via ssh
    ```
    cd nvidia-driver
    wget https://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.90.07/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
    ```
    - change permission
    ```
    sudo chmod +x <driver-file-name>
    ```

1. install driver ( e.g. 550.90.07.):
Pass the driver file name as argument to the script (Attention: with a new driver version the installation script might needs to be updated).
```
sudo ./install_nvidia_driver.sh NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-550.90.07.run
```

Done!

2. check gpu access
```
